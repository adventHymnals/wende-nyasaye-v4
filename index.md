## PREFACE

Never had human ears heard such glorious music as that which thrilled some lonely shepherds in the dark fields of Bethlehem the night that Jesus was born.  ==No worldly music will ever be half so beautiful.==

What made the angels' hearts almost burst with wonder was the sight of the Prince of glory lying a helpless Babe in  ==a donkey's feeding box==, Such humbling of Himself for sinners! What love, never seen before in earth or heaven.

It was then that angels taught us poor sinners how to sing a song of purest joy: "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth, peace, good will toward men." (Luke 2:13, 14).

The songs in this book can be nothing more than an echo of that wonderful song. But such they are, and therefore they are precious - up-lifting, comforting, joyous.  ==There is not a sad or discouraging note in them.== They are songs inspired by a reverent understanding of Jesus' love that passes understanding.  ==Let us cheerfully follow the counsel of David, "Oh sing unto the Lord a new song", by learning to sing the new hymns in this book.==

Our saddened human hearts find truest joy when we lose ourselves in [the] worship of the Lamb that was slain and has redeemed us to God by His own blood. These songs may help to make that worship complete. That your redeemed heart may thrill with the joy of that worship now and forever is the prayer of
